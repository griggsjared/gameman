# Phase 7: Input & Polish

**Status**: Coming Soon - Expand after completing Phase 6

In Phase 7, you'll add joypad input, save states, debugging tools, and polish your emulator for usability and compatibility.

## Overview

**Goal**: Make your emulator playable and polished

**What You'll Build:**
- Joypad input handling (P1 register, buttons)
- Frontend with real-time rendering (SDL2 or similar)
- Keyboard/controller mapping
- Save states (serialize/deserialize emulator state)
- Debugging UI (register viewer, memory inspector)
- Performance profiling and optimization
- ROM compatibility testing

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Joypad input implementation
- [ ] P1 register and joypad interrupts
- [ ] Real-time rendering frontend (SDL2)
- [ ] Keyboard input mapping
- [ ] Save state system
- [ ] Debug UI (registers, memory, disassembly)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Test with multiple commercial games

## Topics Covered

1. **Joypad System** - P1 register (0xFF00), button matrix
2. **Input Handling** - Keyboard/controller to joypad mapping
3. **Frontend** - SDL2 or similar for real-time rendering
4. **Save States** - Serialization of entire emulator state
5. **Debugging Tools** - Register viewer, memory inspector
6. **Disassembler** - Show current instruction
7. **Performance** - Profiling and optimization
8. **ROM Compatibility** - Testing with many games

## Why This Phase is Important

After Phase 7, you'll have:
- A playable emulator!
- Games you can actually play with a keyboard
- Debugging tools for troubleshooting
- Save state capability
- Good performance
- Broad game compatibility

## Coming Soon

Detailed documentation will include:
- P1 register implementation
- Joypad button matrix
- SDL2 integration
- Input handling code
- Save state serialization
- Debug UI design
- Performance profiling techniques
- Optimization strategies
- Game compatibility checklist

**Complete Phase 6 first**, then this guide will be expanded.
